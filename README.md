JavaScript Modal Box

This project is a Modal, box/popup window, appearing or displaying at the top of the page. This is not suppose to be a complex project but one that is useful in going over the basics HTML, CSS with JavaScript. A more complex Modal box can be achieved and done with more parts inegrated into it!

This uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript but with a main use of Vanilla JavaScript.
